Matlab code written by Sam Khalandovsky, 2013.

fingergui.m- generates a basic 3D model of a 5-fingered hand, using the assumption of linear curvature. GUI sliders change curvature of top and bottom sections.

analyzeTiff.m- processes given .tif file as an image stack, each image having two lines of the finger's top and bottom contours. Produces a graphical representation of the algorithm for each frame, and the 'poses' variable contains the pose of each finger.
