This is VoxCad 0.9.91, slightly modified to allow for a second global temperature variable. I recommend using the latest version of VoxCad instead if possible.

Under Windows it shoule be compiled with Visual Studio 2010, Qt 4.8, and Qwt 6.0. Qwt 6.0 should be built with Visual Studio 2007. The newest version of VoxCad no longer uses Qwt, so it's only necessary for this version.

To use the visual studio solution, you must have the qt framework installed (with the visual studio plugin)

qwt (a qt plotting plugin) is also needed.
